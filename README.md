# Welcome to project MeghHive

## Project info

**Description**:  Team MeghHive is building a cloud-powered web application that forecasts air quality by combining NASAâ€™s TEMPO satellite data with ground sensors and weather information. Using AI/ML models (LSTM, XGBoost) for time-series prediction, our solution delivers real-time air quality insights, health alerts, and recommendations. The system is built with Python (Flask/Django), Node.js, React.js, Leaflet.js maps, and Plotly charts, and deployed on scalable cloud platforms (AWS/GCP). By transforming EarthData into action, we aim to protect vulnerable communities and move toward cleaner, healthier skies.
